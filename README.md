### About PCA (source Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis):

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
